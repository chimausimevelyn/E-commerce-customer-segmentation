E-commerce Customer Segmentation involves
collecting customer data and applying clustering
algorithms like K-means to group customers based
on behavior and demographics. The process includes
defining segmentation criteria, analyzing segment
traits, and tailoring marketing strategies for
improved engagement. Personalized
recommendations and dynamic pricing cater to
individual segment preferences. Strategies for
customer retention are developed, and continuous
refinement occurs through feedback and adaptation
to market trends. This approach optimizes
marketing efforts, enhances customer experience,
and fosters loyalty by delivering targeted and
relevant interactions for specific customer groups in
the e-commerce ecosystem.
